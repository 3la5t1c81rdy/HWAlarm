# HWAlarm - v1.0
A simple Homework Alarm program I made in Python. Does everything you'd expect of a task list.

**This is still in development with minimal features. As of now, you need to manually remove tasks once you want to clear them.**
## Dependencies
  - Pygame
  - PyWin32 (with all its modules correctly installed)
  - Time (Standard Library)

## How to use
  1. Running the HWAlarm.py will open a new window along with a console.
      - *Left-click* to add homework/task
      - *Right-click* to remove homework/task
      - Scroll using mouse wheels
