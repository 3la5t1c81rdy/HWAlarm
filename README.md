# HWAlarm - v1.0
A simple Homework Alarm program I made in Python. Does everything you'd expect of a task list.

Dependencies:
  Pygame
  PyWin32 (with all its modules correctly installed)
  Time (Standard Library)

How to use:
  Running the HWAlarm.py will open a new window along with a console.
    *Left-click* to add homework/task
    *Right-click* to remove homework/task
    Scroll using mouse wheels
  **This is still in development with minimal features. As of now, you need to manually remove tasks once you want to clear them**
